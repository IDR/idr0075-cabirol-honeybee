### Description
To study the spatial distribution of synaptic complexes called microglomeruli in the mushroom body neuropils of the honeybee brain, those structures where imaged by two-photon microscopy. A data analysis method was developed to automatically obtain the loci of those structures from large volume samples allowing to analyse their 3D density distribution.
